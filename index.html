        <p> The <u>World Wide Web (WWW)</u>, commonly known as the Web, 
            is an information system enabling documents and 
            other web resources to be accessed over the Internet.[1]<br>
            Documents and downloadable media are made available to the network 
            through web servers and can be accessed by programs such as web browsers.<br> 
            Servers and resources on the World Wide Web are identified and located 
            through character strings called uniform resource locators (URLs).<br>
            The original and still very common document type is a web page formatted 
            in Hypertext Markup Language (HTML).<br>
            This markup language supports plain text, images, embedded video and audio contents, and scripts (short programs) 
            that implement complex user interaction. <br> 
            The HTML language also supports hyperlinks (embedded URLs) which provide immediate access to other web resources.<br> 
            Web navigation, or web surfing, is the common practice of following such 
            hyperlinks across multiple websites. <br>
            Web applications are web pages that function as application software. The information in the Web is transferred 
            across the Internet using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).<br>
            Multiple web resources with a common theme and usually a common domain name make up a website. 
            A single web server may provide multiple websites, while some websites, 
            especially the most popular ones, may be provided by multiple servers.<br>
            Website content is provided by a myriad of companies, organizations, 
            entertainment, commercial, and government information.<br>
            The World Wide Web has become the world's dominant software platform.
            [2][3][4][5] It is the primary tool billions of people worldwide use to interact with the Internet.
            [6]The Web was invented by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN in 1989 and 
            opened to the public in 1991. It was conceived as a "universal linked information system".
